# Projects-

Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository! 

My name is Peter Gezah and I am currently a Data Science student at the University of Liverpool. 
This repository is a collection of my personal projects and academic coursework as I document my progress as an AI and data scholar.

As a student, I am constantly learning and improving my skills in various programming languages, data visualization tools, and machine learning algorithms. 
Through my repository, I hope to showcase my knowledge and expertise in these areas, as well as demonstrate my passion for data science and its potential to solve complex problems and drive innovation.
I believe that GitHub is an excellent platform for collaborating with others, sharing my work with a wider community, and receiving feedback and suggestions from fellow data scientists and researchers. I am excited to continue building my portfolio and contributing to the field of data science through this repository.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository, and please feel free to explore my projects and coursework. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via petergezah@gmail.com.
